# Escape-from-College
A Text adventure in which you attempt to navigate the horrible beauracracy that is College. Graduate or die!


***Story Plot***
A student starts at the entrance to the college.  In the entrollment center, the student can choose from a list of degrees which gives a brief description and a list of the required courses.
Upon choosing a degree, the student then walks into the finance office and talks to the worker. In a conversation with the finance worker, fees are mentioned.. dozens of fees.
The student tries to say something but the worker is ignoring everything. Eventually the fees keep stacking up and start eating away at the student's health bar 
and eventually causes the student to faint. The next screen then comes to waking up in a bed in the nursing office. The president of the college then comes to the student apologizing for 
the inconvenience that the student encountered in the finance office and gets the student started right away in classes. The college president gives the student a cell phone
and says he will create a set of private classes for the student that the student can start at any time by calling the president to set up. 

The student will then go through a series of challenges in each class that is required for the chosen major.

In the end, the student will complete the major by completing an internship. After completing the internship, it is revealed that the college president has had it out for the 
student from the start and has tried to pursuade the student to drop out by setting up bizarre events in each private class. The student then has to battle the college president. 
After winning the final boss battle, the vice president of the college congratulates the student on defeating a college president who has been making terrible working conditions for the 
entire college staff. Even though the classes that were completed weren't up to the normal standards of each class, the student is given a degree in the field of their choosing.
