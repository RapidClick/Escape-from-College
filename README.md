***Start of Game***
A student starts at the entrance to the college.  In the entrollment center, the student can choose from a list of degrees which gives a brief description and a list of the required courses.
Upon choosing a degree, the student then walks into the finance office and talks to the worker. In a conversation with the finance worker, fees are mentioned.. dozens of fees.
The student tries to say something but the worker is ignoring everything. Eventually the fees keep stacking up and start eating away at the student's health bar 
and eventually causes the student to faint. The next screen then comes to waking up in a bed in the nursing office. The president of the school then comes to the student apologizing for 
the inconvenience that the student encountered in the finance office and gets the student started right away in classes.
