current issues:

	reverting to and resetting main menu to reflect changes after the main menu has set the content
	pane of the frame to something of another class
	
	possible fixes:
	-ancestor listeners
		(overriding the add and remove methods of all the custom classes and setting them so all they change is
			visibility?)
	-creating all objects outside of GUI class but giving each thing a method to retrieve those objects, then
		adding listeners in GUI class only
	-giving each object the object above it as a parameter so that it can modify upwards as needed
	-static variables, instances, and objects
	
	
	
	resize of window bug
	
	possible fixes:
	-ancestor listeners
	-setting only 2 default sizes and having a method that allows you to change between the 2
	-disabling screen resizing
